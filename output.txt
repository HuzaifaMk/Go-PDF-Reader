A computer-controlled machine produces plastic sheets The thickness of each sheet must be 
within a certain tolerance The sheets are kept below 50 °C as they move over rollers at 10 metres 
per second
 
Three parameters need to be monitored all the time

Each seat on a flight is uniquely identified on an LCD above the seat For example, seat 035C is 
shown as:
 
The first three characters are digits that represent the row
 
The fourth character is the seat position in that row This is a single letter, A to F, that is stored as a 
hexadecimal value
 
Each of the four display characters can be stored in a 4-bit register For example, 0 and C would 
be represented as:
0000
C:
1100
8421
0:
 

(a) 
Show how the 4-bit registers would store the remaining two characters, 3 and 5

8 A bank offers an online service to its customers The bank has developed a “
SafeToUse
” system 
that asks each customer to enter four randomly chosen characters from their password each time 
they log in
 The customer selects these four characters from drop-down boxes For example:
 Please select the 2
nd character 
  5th character
  6th character
  8th character
 

(a) (i) 
Explain why it is more secure to use drop-down boxes rather than entering characters 
using a keyboard
 
 
 
 


[2]
  (ii) 
Give a reason why the system asks for four characters chosen at random

[2]100478/11/M/J/16© UCLES 20169 Check digits are used to ensure the accuracy of entered data
 A 7-digit number has an extra digit on the right, called the check digit
digit position:12345678digit:––––––––  check digit
 The check digit is calculated as follows:
� each digit in the number is multiplied by its digit position
� the seven results are then added together
� this total is divided by 11
� the remainder gives the check digit (if the remainder = 10, the check digit is X)
 

(a) 
Calculate the check digit for the following number Show all your working
4      2      4      1      5      0      8      …

correct if the check digit is correct 
OR incorrect if the check digit is incorrect

10 Six security issues and 
six descriptions are shown below
 Draw a line to link each security issue to its correct description
 Security issue Description
illegal access to a computer system without the owner’s consent or 
knowledge
software that gathers information by 
monitoring key presses on a user’s 
keyboard; the data is sent back to the 
originator of the software
malicious code installed on the hard drive of a user’s computer or on a web 
server; this code will re-direct the user 
to a fake website without the user’s 
knowledge
creator of code sends out a legitimate-looking email in the hope of gathering personal and financial 
information from the recipient; it 
requires the user to click on the link in 
the email or attachmenta message given to a web browser by 
a web server; it is stored in a text file; 
the message is then sent back to the 
server each time the browser requests 
a page from the server
program or code that replicates itself; 
designed to amend, delete or copy 
data or files on a user’s computer; 
often causes the computer to crash or 
run slowly
