Difference between Psychologist and 
psychiatrist 
A psychologist treats a patient through psychotherapy, 
helping to relieve symptoms through behavioral change. 
The 
role of the psychiatrist, who is a medical doctor, 
focuses more on prescribing medication and other 
interventions to manage mental health conditions.

medical 
management 
of mental health issues
.
Thought processes, emotions, memories, dreams, perceptions, and so 
on cannot be seen physically, like a skin rash or heart 
efect

BRANCHES OF PSYCHOLOGY

**Page 6**

CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
Clinical 
psychology integrates science, theory, and practice in order to 
understand, predict and relieve problems with adjustment, disability, 
and discomfort. It promotes adaption, adjustment, and personal 
development.
A clinical psychologist concentrates on the intellectual, emotional, 
biological, psychological, social, and behavioral aspects of human 
prncettapnslarsvycasocioeconomic levels.
Clinical psychology can help us to understand, prevent, and alleviate 
psychologically
-
caused distress or dysfunction, and promote an 
ivdswl-
being and personal development.
Psychological assessment and psychotherapy are central to the 
practice of clinical psychology, but clinical psychologists are often 
also involved in research, training, forensic testimony, and other areas

PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY
Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make 
each individual unique. Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow)
For example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the 
conscious and unconscious parts of the mind were carried out over the lifespan.
More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative 
approach. Rather than explaining how personality arises, research is focused on 
identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and determining how these 
traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in 
any given 
situation
Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and 
many have proposed that five trait dimensions are 
sufficient

COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
Cognitive 
psychology investigates internal mental processes, 
such as problem solving, memory, learning, and language. It 
looks at how people think, perceive, communicate, 
remember, and learn. It is closely related to
neuroscience, 
philosophy, and linguistics.
Cognitive psychologists look at how people acquire, process, 
and store information.
Practical applications include how to improve memory, 
increase the accuracy of decision
-
making, or how to set up 
educational programs to boost learning
.

**Page 9**

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
This 
is the scientific study of systematic psychological changes that a 
person experiences over the life span, often referred to as human 
development.
It focuses not only on infants and young children but also teenagers, 
adults, and older people.
Factors include motor skills, problem solving, moral understanding, 
acquiring language, emotions, personality, self
-
concept, and identity 
formation.
It also looks at innate mental structures against learning through 
epewasctrir environmental factors and how this impacts development.
Developmental psychology overlaps with fields such as linguistics
.

**Page 10**

EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY
Evolutionary 
psychology looks at how human behavior, for 
example language, has been affected by psychological 
adjustments during evolution.
An evolutionary psychologist believes that many human 
psychological traits are adaptive in that they have 
enabled us to survive over thousands of years
.

FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY
Forensic 
psychology involves applying psychology to 
criminal investigation and the law.
A forensic psychologist practices psychology as a science 
within the criminal justice system and civil courts.
It involves assessing the psychological factors that might 
influence a case or behavior and presenting the findings in 
court.

**Page 12**

HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
Health 
psychology is also called behavioral medicine or medical 
psychology.
It observes how behavior, biology, and social context influence 
illness and health.
A physician often looks first at the biological causes of a 
disease, but a health psychologist will focus on the whole 
person and what influences their health status. This may include 
their socioeconomic status, education, and background, and 
behaviors that may have an impact on the disease, such as 
compliance with instructions and medication.
Health psychologists usually work alongside other medical 
professionals in clinical settings.

**Page 13**

NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
Neuropsychology 
looks at the structure and function of the 
brain in relation to behaviors and psychological processes. A 
neuropsychology may be involved if a condition involves 
lesions in the brain, and assessments that involve recording 
electrical activity in the brain.
A neuropsychological evaluation is used to determine 
whether a person is likely to experience behavioral problems 
following suspected or diagnosed brain injury, such as 
a
stroke.
The results can enable a doctor to provide treatment that 
may help the individual achieve possible improvements in 
cognitive damage that has occurred
.

**Page 14**

OCCUPATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY
Occupational 
or organizational psychologists are involved in 
assessing and making recommendations about the 
performance of people at work and in training
.
They help companies to find more effective ways to 
function, and to understand how people and groups behave 
at 
work.
This information can help improve effectiveness, efficiency, 
job satisfaction, and employee retention.

**Page 15**

SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
Social 
psychology uses scientific methods to understand how 
social influences impact human behavior. It seeks to explain 
how feelings, behavior, and thoughts are influenced by the 
actual, imagined or implied presence of other people.
A social psychologist looks at group behavior, social 
perception, non
-
verbal behavior, conformity, aggression, 
prejudice, and leadership. Social perception and social 
interaction are seen as key to understanding social behavior.
Other
branches include
military, consumer, educational, 
cross
-
cultural, and environmental psychology. The number of 
branches continues to grow.
